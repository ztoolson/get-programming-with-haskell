-- Q5.1: Now that you know about partial application, you no longer need to use genIfEvenX. Redefine ifEvenInc, ifEvenDouble, and ifEvenSquare by using ifEven and partial application.
ifEvenInc = ifEven (\n -> n + 1)
ifEvenDouble = ifEven (\n -> 2*n)
ifEvenSquare = ifEven (\n -> n*n)

-- Q5.2: Even if Haskell didnâ€™t have partial application, you could hack together some approximations.
-- Following a similar pattern to flipBinaryArgs (figure 5.6), write a func- tion binaryPartialApplication that takes a binary function 
-- and one argument and returns a new function waiting for the missing argument.
